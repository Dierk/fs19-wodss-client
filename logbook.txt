18.03.19 put datePicker "component" into it's own file, use dropdown as date picker
         - drag and drop does not support touch events for mobile devices
           touchstart, touchmove, touchend would need to handle x,y positions manually
           or we would need a dependency like interact.js.
           Decision: leave this for the moment. It is not essential.

15.03.19 Start project as requested by the students :-)
         - use language level ES6
         - use JS module system and rollup as bundler
         - use testing "framework" from web programming module
         - start with a simple and fixed-size project allocation view (drag-and-drop)

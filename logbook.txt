27.04.19 streamlined the UI to make the important information better stand out
         (over- /undercommitment, -staffing)
25.04.19 refactoring into separate components for allocation, project, developer, assignment
         cleaning the tests, making bundles.
         Make a focus_handling branch that restores the focus after the view has been refreshed.
         Strategy is to find the absolute css selector for the currently focused element, save it in the state,
         and set the focus after refresh accordingly.
24.04.19 added assignments to the projects, add developer images, animate status monolog
         mini now takes a onRefreshed function to clean data off the flash scope
17.04.19 experiment with a 2.5D UI, glossy background, perspective and transform
19.03.19 make sure the end date is never before beginDate.
18.03.19 put datePicker "component" into it's own file, use dropdown as date picker
         - drag and drop does not support touch events for mobile devices
           touchstart, touchmove, touchend would need to handle x,y positions manually
           or we would need a dependency like interact.js.
           Decision: leave this for the moment. It is not essential.

15.03.19 Start project as requested by the students :-)
         - use language level ES6
         - use JS module system and rollup as bundler
         - use testing "framework" from web programming module
         - start with a simple and fixed-size project allocation view (drag-and-drop)
